    <div class="text text-1">
      I walked for two hours today and both the skin of my feet were coming off. I think I was probably walking in <span id="quote">the middle of nowhere</span>, like a specter wandering in the city.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-2">
      I recalled some things far from high school.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-3">
      Everyday I was super busy in studying, felt stressful all the time. So, at night occasionally, I would go aimlessly on the street, just to feel the crowds passing by me.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-4">
      I remember specially one time during the Christmas, the trees on the
      square were full of small colorful lights, then I just stood there looking at people. Do you know that kind of stillness, like time stops inside your body? I almost heard the opera sound around. The most enjoyable moment for me is this
      quietness in the bustle and noise.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-5">
      When at night in Beijing, me and a friend liked to walk in the quiet alley near the main street. We met cats on the tree and puppy running on the tiled roof. Autumn night in Beijing is so suitable for walking, some secret Hutong are the most
      beautiful place there. I also mentioned Chang'an Avenue closed to Tiananmen Square, it is the best place to bike. Then, in winter, I liked to go to houhai, the lake was frozen, with so many people skating.

      I think walking means to set free the corporal body at a certain extent, but my concept about freedom is still very vague.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-7">
      When I knew the story about Herzog had walked from Munich to Paris in 1974, in order to prevent the death of Lotte Eisner. I felt I shared some similar weird energy with him, and I feel that from you too. <span id="quote">“In full faith”</span> Herzog wrote in the
      book. I use non-stop watching, reading, listening and making stuff to try to keep away from afflictive thoughts in my brain. The walking is also a way to relieve mental suffering by exhausting my body. Torture. You might say that is not good,
      it’s an escape.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-8">
      “…you have to have a lot of discipline and be a masochist.” I took a screenshot of these words, the original context was about being an artist. I don’t know if I am an artist, but I think that is who I am.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-9">
      Very often I get trance, like being placed in a wrong universe. You often tell me how to focus on the positive side. I work hard to implement it. I usually watch Chris Marker’s movies several times, once focus on the images, once on the text,
      then sometimes another time again for understanding the two together. Lots of memories there.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-10">
      I can’t imagine what it will be like when I recall now. Maybe it will be that I happened upon a book in the library, the music you shared with me, or the films we talked about - the ecstasy I got after watching Herzog and Marker. Films save my
      life, images are stored in my brain! But towards to the physical scene, I barely feel anything here.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-11">
      After a rain, I saw a little sparrow bathing in the pond.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-12">
      I saw a girl wearing the green floral dress, with reddish brown hair and a pair of ponytail. She looked about 20 years old and passed by me with barefoot. I remember she looked around the showcase of grocery store. I was totally attracted by
      such an innocent and curious expression in her eyes, thought she might be a fairy from the forest. And a few seconds when I turned around, she just disappeared in my sight.

      Otherwise, there is almost nothing left in my mind. I was walking in a huge container, a hidden world, while thinking the value of it. It is also like walking in the middle of no where, everything I passed is not really necessary for me.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-14">
      Regardless of visual factors, I actually walked in the blank, or, in an empty dark.
    </div>

    <div class="text text-15">
      On occasion, I encountered a morning glory at the corner, or the rabbit suddenly appeared on the street, those moments were the glimmer in the gloominess for me. The 5-hour film I sent to you, “As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief
      Glimpses of Beauty” - footages of memories from Jonas Mekas’ whole life. I felt connection the moment when I knew the title of the film.

      I sent you this before, but I am not sure if you have time to read it - the letter of C.L.R James to Constance Webb. I saw it by chance on the internet.
      <br>
      <br>
      “When the disciples asked Christ about the world to come and the places they were to get in it, he told them, ‘The kingdom of Heaven is within you.’ They could not understand it. They just couldn’t. The glory of life in our age is that this
      intense, individual, personal life can, in fact must, be lived in harmony with the great social forces that are now striving to carry humanity over the last barrier. When I say I love you, it comes from very, very far.”
